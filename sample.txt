I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Android Developer position at MetroMart, the leading online grocery delivery service. My name is Alan Jethro Ecuacion from Malaybalay City, Bukidnon. I recently graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer engineering in University of Mindanao Main Campus Davao City, and I bring with me 1.5 years of hands-on experience in native Android application development, honed both academically and through freelancing projects.
